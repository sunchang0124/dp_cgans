class Onto_BaseTabularModel:
    """Base class for all the tabular models.

    The ``BaseTabularModel`` class defines the common API that all the
    TabularModels need to implement, as well as common functionality.

    Args:
        field_names (list[str]):
            List of names of the fields that need to be modeled
            and included in the generated output data. Any additional
            fields found in the data will be ignored and will not be
            included in the generated output.
            If ``None``, all the fields found in the data are used.
        field_types (dict[str, dict]):
            Dictinary specifying the data types and subtypes
            of the fields that will be modeled. Field types and subtypes
            combinations must be compatible with the SDV Metadata Schema.
        field_transformers (dict[str, str]):
            Dictinary specifying which transformers to use for each field.
            Available transformers are:

                * ``integer``: Uses a ``NumericalTransformer`` of dtype ``int``.
                * ``float``: Uses a ``NumericalTransformer`` of dtype ``float``.
                * ``categorical``: Uses a ``CategoricalTransformer`` without gaussian noise.
                * ``categorical_fuzzy``: Uses a ``CategoricalTransformer`` adding gaussian noise.
                * ``one_hot_encoding``: Uses a ``OneHotEncodingTransformer``.
                * ``label_encoding``: Uses a ``LabelEncodingTransformer``.
                * ``boolean``: Uses a ``BooleanTransformer``.
                * ``datetime``: Uses a ``DatetimeTransformer``.

        anonymize_fields (dict[str, str]):
            Dict specifying which fields to anonymize and what faker
            category they belong to.
        primary_key (str):
            Name of the field which is the primary key of the table.
        constraints (list[Constraint, dict]):
            List of Constraint objects or dicts.
        table_metadata (dict or metadata.Table):
            Table metadata instance or dict representation.
            If given alongside any other metadata-related arguments, an
            exception will be raised.
            If not given at all, it will be built using the other
            arguments or learned from the data.
        rounding (int, str or None):
            Define rounding scheme for ``NumericalTransformer``. If set to an int, values
            will be rounded to that number of decimal places. If ``None``, values will not
            be rounded. If set to ``'auto'``, the transformer will round to the maximum number
            of decimal places detected in the fitted data. Defaults to ``'auto'``.
        min_value (int, str or None):
            Specify the minimum value the ``NumericalTransformer`` should use. If an integer
            is given, sampled data will be greater than or equal to it. If the string ``'auto'``
            is given, the minimum will be the minimum value seen in the fitted data. If ``None``
            is given, there won't be a minimum. Defaults to ``'auto'``.
        max_value (int, str or None):
            Specify the maximum value the ``NumericalTransformer`` should use. If an integer
            is given, sampled data will be less than or equal to it. If the string ``'auto'``
            is given, the maximum will be the maximum value seen in the fitted data. If ``None``
            is given, there won't be a maximum. Defaults to ``'auto'``.

            float_rtol (float):
                Maximum tolerance when considering a float match. This is the maximum
                relative distance at which a float value will be considered a match
                when performing reject-sampling based conditioning. Defaults to 0.01.

                within `max_retries` trials. If `True` prints a warning and returns
                as many rows as it was able to sample within `max_retries`.
                Defaults to False.
